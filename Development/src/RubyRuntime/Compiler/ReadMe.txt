Originally developed at Queensland University of Technology

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the implementation of the Ruby.NET compiler.
It is part of the runtime library as it is used by "eval".
It contains a hand written scanner and an auto-generated parser
based on a yacc like specication (parser.y) with C# semantic actions.
The parser is generated by the Gardens Point Parser generator 
which is included in this distribution. To regenerate the parser:

gppg.exe parser.y > parser.y.cs

The parser generator generates a partial class, the other half
of which is contained in parser.cs (for ease of editting).

The parser builds an abstract syntax tree (AST), the nodes of which
are defined in the AST sub-directory. Each node class contains
a GenCode method that is used for generating .NET CIL code
using our PERWAPI (Portable Executable File Reader/Writer API),
also included in this distribution. GenCodeFacade acts as a 
facade to this API.
